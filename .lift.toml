# Ignore warnings not relevant to this specific project:
#
# 1) FindSecBugs will identify our choice of random number generator as predictable.
# However, the usage in this repository is not security related. And in fact, 
# predictability is useful and desirable in our case (e.g., user's chosen instance
# number corresponds to seed for random number generator. 
#
# 2) FindSecBugs identifies a false positive instance of PATH_TRAVERSAL_IN. It seems
# to be ignoring use of @SuppressWarnings, so doesn't seem possible to flag the false
# positive alone. Unfortunately forced to ignore in general.
