<h2>Introduction</h2>
This tutorial feature of the Interactive Bin Packing Application 
will walk you through all
functionality of the system, while also explaining concepts that include
combinatorial optimization, bin packing, and constructive heuristics
for the bin packing problem.  If you already have knowledge in these
concepts, you may also feel free to just explore the functionality of
the application on your own.  Otherwise, we suggest keeping the tutorial 
window open to the side of the application so you can easily refer back
to it as necessary.

<p>The objectives of the Interactive Bin Packing Application
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>gaining an understanding of the bin packing problem, and more generally how
the bin packing problem is an example of a combinatorial optimization
problem;</li>
<li>learning about constructive heuristics;</li>
<li>learning about the most common constructive heuristics for the bin
packing problem, including first-fit, best-fit, first-fit decreasing, and
best-fit decreasing; and</li>
<li>serving as an interactive environment for students (whether in the formal 
context of a class, or just for informal self-guided learning) to explore

<h2><a name="copt"></a>Combinatorial Optimization</h2>

An optimization problem is a problem where one must find the
value of <MATH>x</MATH> that optimizes function <MATH>&fnof;(x)</MATH>.
Optimization problems can involve minimizing, i.e., computing
<MATH>x' = <BOX>argmin</BOX><SUB>x</SUB>(&fnof;(x))</MATH>, or maximizing, i.e., computing
<MATH>x' = <BOX>argmax</BOX><SUB>x</SUB>(&fnof;(x))</MATH>.
The function <MATH>&fnof;(x)</MATH> that we're optimizing is known as the
objective function. 

<p>In a combinatorial optimization problem, the domain of the objective function
<MATH>&fnof;(x)</MATH> is a discrete set.  A few examples of discrete domains include
the set of integers, the set of spanning trees of a graph, the set of paths 
of a graph,
the set of permutations of the elements of some discrete set, 
and the set of partitions of the elements of some discrete set, to name just a few
examples.</p>

<p>A classic example often given of a combinatorial optimization problem is the
traveling salesperson problem (TSP).  In the TSP, you have a finite set of cities, and
you must find a tour of the cities to minimize total distance traveled, where a
tour is defined as a simple cycle that visits every city.  The domain in this case
is the set of all permutations of the set of cities.</p>

<p>Some combinatorial optimization problems can be efficiently solved.  For example,
the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph can be computed in polynomial time,
such as by using either Prim's algorithm or Kruskal's algorithm.  The single source
shortest path problem can be solved in polynomial time using Dijkstra's algorithm
or the Bellman-Ford algorithm.</p>

<p>Many other combinatorial optimization problems, however, are proven to be NP-Hard.
For example, the TSP is an NP-Hard problem.  As an NP-Hard problem, there doesn't currently
exist any algorithm for the TSP that is guaranteed to compute the optimal solution
in polynomial time.  And such a polynomial time algorithm is not likely to exist.
The same is true of the Bin Packing problem, which is the focus of this tutorial
application.</p>

<p>In the next section below, we'll focus on the specific combinatorial optimization
problem covered by this tutorial, the problem known as Bin Packing.  For additional
examples of combinatorial optimization problems, see 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization">Wikipedia 
page on combinatorial optimization</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="bin"></a>Bin Packing</h2>

The Bin Packing problem is a combinatorial optimization problem in which we must
fit a set of items into a set of bins while minimizing the number of bins used.
This problem has many practical applications.  Some of the obvious applications
are in logistics, such as packing shipments into trucks or airplanes.  Another example
is that of creating a compilation of the works of a musical artist on a set of CDs.  
Do people still use those?  Each CD is a bin.  Each song is an item, and its runtime 
is its size.  If you want to minimize production costs, then you want to use as
few CDs as possible. Some scheduling problems involve bin packing as well.
For example, scheduling when to air advertisements on television has an element of
bin packing. Some advertisers may have paid extra for prime-time coverage.  Others 
may have paid for multiple plays during a single evening, and would find it undesirable if
all of those airings were back-to-back. So it
is more than just a bin packing problem. However, if you ignore those aspects, the
problem becomes one of assigning advertisements (which may vary in length) to
commercial breaks during television programs, which is essentially a bin packing problem.
Placing files in fixed-length memory blocks on the file system
is a computer science application of bin packing. 

<p>Let's now define the Bin Packing problem more formally.
Imagine that we have an unlimited supply of bins, all of which are identical in
capacity.  Let that capacity be an integer <MATH>C</MATH>.  We are given a set
of <MATH>N</MATH> items <MATH>I = { i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, i<sub>N</sub> }</MATH>,
and a size function <MATH>S : I &rarr; &#x2124;</MATH>.  We must partition the
set of items <MATH>I</MATH> into a set of bins 
<MATH>B = { b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, &hellip; }</MATH>.  
Each bin <MATH>b &isin; B</MATH> in the solution is thus a 
subset of the items, <MATH>b &sube; I</MATH>, that
must satisfy the following constraint:
<MATH>&sum;<sub>i &isin; b</sub> S(i) &le; C</MATH>.  Every item must be
assigned to a bin, such that <MATH>I = &cup;<sub>b &isin; B</sub></MATH>,
and such that no item is assigned to multiple bins, i.e., 
<MATH>b<sub>j</sub> &cap; b<sub>k</sub> = &empty;, &forall; j &ne; k, b<sub>j</sub>,b<sub>k</sub> &isin; B</MATH>.
The objective function
that we must minimize is <MATH>&fnof;(B) = |B|</MATH>.
That is, we must assign all of the items to bins to minimize the
number of bins used, without violating the bin capacities.</p> 

<p>Before proceeding in the tutorial, try assigning items to bins in the
application.  The application, by default, is in Practice Mode, which
doesn't enforce any particular solving procedure.  You are free to move
items around to any bin where it will fit.  The top of the user interface
lists all of the items in the problem instance.  Each item has a simple
single character name, and its size is the integer in parentheses.  The
bin capacity is shown, and the application keeps track of the amount
of space already occupied by items (see "Used").  The combo boxes at the
bottom allow you to choose an item and a destination.  If you change your
mind about an item, just choose "Floor" as the destination.  The "Move"
button moves the chosen item to the chosen destination as long as it is legal
(i.e., it won't allow you to violate the bin capacity).  If you want to start 
over, just click "Reset".</p>

<p>How many bins did you use?  For the default problem instance that is
loaded into the interface when you start the application, the optimal
solution uses 5 bins.  If you managed to fit all of the items into 5 bins,
then great job!  If you used more than 5 bins, then feel free to try rearranging
the items to squeeze them into 5 bins.  But don't stress about it.  The Bin
Packing problem is NP-Hard, so there doesn't likely exist an algorithm whose
worst case runtime is a polynomial in the number of items that is guaranteed 
to find the optimal solution.  However, since this instance has only 20 items,
then if you are a good puzzle solver you should be able to work it out.</p>

<p>If you did successfully find the 5-bin solution to the default instance, 
and if you want to try
your hand at additional instances, you can use the "Problem" menu to generate
random Bin Packing instances.  Both "Random Instance" and "Select Instance Number"
generate a random problem instance.  However, if you use "Select Instance Number"
then you can regenerate that very same instance again in the future.  The application
doesn't have a solver built-in, so I can't tell you the number of bins
in the optimal solutions to the random instances.
The "Operations" menu has a couple of commands that sort the items
by size, which you might find useful.</p>

<h2><a name="bound"></a>Lower Bounds</h2>

When solving a combinatorial optimization problem, it is sometimes useful
to compute a lower bound for the objective function if the problem is a
minimization problem, and similarly an upper bound if the problem is a
maximization problem. Since Bin Packing is a minimization problem, we will
explain the concept with a lower bound. A lower bound is a value that is 
definitely less than or equal to the optimal value. It is often possible to
compute a lower bound much easier than it is to compute the actual optimal
solution. Although there is no guarantee that a solution exists whose value
is that of the lower bound, if you are able to find a solution whose value is
the lower bound, then you know there is no reason to search any further 
for a better solution.

<p>There is a very easy way to compute a lower bound for a Bin Packing instance.
Simply sum the sizes of the items. And then compute the ceiling of that sum
divided by the bin capacity. This lower bound makes the very naive assumption
that it is possible to pack the items in bins so that there is no wasted space.
You clearly can't do any better than this, although it is rarely possible to
actually pack the bins in this way.</p>

<p>In the Operations Menu of the application, there is a command "Compute
Lower Bound" that computes a lower bound for the current instance. Use that
command to compute the lower bound for the current Bin Packing instance.
If you are still on the default instance, you will find that the lower
bound is 5 bins. In this case, it turns out that the optimal solution is
also 5 bins, but you have no way of knowing for sure at this point.</p>

<h2><a name="heur"></a>Constructive Heuristics</h2>

Recall that the Bin Packing problem, as well as many other combinatorial optimization
problems, is NP-Hard.  Although you very well may have found the optimal 5-bin solution
to the default instance in the previous section, optimally solving bin packing
instances increases in difficulty very rapidly as the number of items in the instance 
increases.

<p>One technique that is sometimes used if you need to generate a good enough solution
quickly is to use something called a Constructive Heuristic.  A heuristic is
a practical problem solving approach that quickly provides a solution of sufficient
quality, while using relatively little time.  A Constructive Heuristic is a particular
type of heuristic that begins with an empty solution, and then repeatedly applies some 
rule to build that solution until it is complete.  The result may or may not be optimal,
and in most cases you may have no way of knowing whether or not it is optimal.</p>

<p>Here is a simple heuristic for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Recall that
for a TSP, one must tour a set of cities with minimal distance traveled.  A nearest
city heuristic works as follows.  Pick a random city to start (a TSP solution is a cycle
of all of the cities, so it really doesn't matter where you start).  Next,
compute the distance to the remaining cities and travel to the city nearest your present location.
Repeat this selection of nearest of the remaining cities until you've visited all of them.
Finally return to your starting city to complete the tour.  For anything other than
trivial instances, you are unlikely to generate the optimal tour for the TSP this way.
But for some applications, it may be of sufficient quality.</p>

<p>There are also search algorithms that utilize constructive heuristics, but which
expand the search around that heuristic solution in various ways.  For example, there
are stochastic sampling algorithms, such as Heuristic-Biased Stochastic Sampling (HBSS)
of Bresina (1996) and Value-Biased Stochastic Sampling (VBSS) of Cicirello and Smith (2005)
that randomize Constructive Heuristics.  One can also apply a hill climbing search to
further optimize the solution generated by a Constructive Heuristic.
But these are beyond the scope of this tutorial and the Interactive Bin Packing Application.</p>

<p>In the next few sections below, we will look at some of the most common Constructive
Heuristics for the Bin Packing problem.  And you can practice your knowledge of how they
work in the Interactive Bin Packing Application.</p>

<h2><a name="ff"></a>First-Fit</h2>

The first Constructive Heuristic for the Bin Packing problem that we will examine is
known as First-Fit.  It is the simplest of the heuristics that we will consider.
When using the First-Fit heuristic, you simply iterate over the items in whatever order
they are given to you. In the case of the Interactive Bin Packing Application, this
arbitrary order is alphabetical by their single character name.  For each item taken
in this arbitrary order, you must choose a bin.  You choose the first bin where the item
fits.  In other words, if you have an array of bins, then of those bins with sufficient 
space, you choose the one with lowest index.

<p>Let's practice in the Interactive Bin Packing Application to get a feel for how
First-Fit works.  In the "Mode" menu, select "First-Fit."  Doing so will disable the
sorting commands in the "Operations" menu.  The First-Fit Mode will give you feedback along
the way with each item you place (or attempt to place) in bins.  If your action is
not the action that First-Fit would take, then the application won't allow the action.
With first-fit, you should simply choose the next item based on whatever order they 
are given to you.  So in this case, the
first item you will place is item A.  You will put item A into the first bin where it
fits, in this case simply starting Bin 1.  You will now move onto the next item in the
sequence, item B, and place it in the first bin where it fits, which in this case is
also Bin 1.  Assuming that you are working through this with the default instance,
then after those first two placements, Bin 1 has only 31 units of space remaining,
which is insufficient for item C, so item C will go into Bin 2.  Likewise, item D
will go into Bin 2.  Next, you will place item E.  Item E will actually fit any of the
bins, but with First-Fit you choose the first bin where it fits.  So in this case,
item E should go into Bin 1.  Continue to follow the First-Fit heuristic until
you have all of the items in bins.</p>

<p>If you want more practice with First-Fit, then use the "Problem" menu to generate 
a random instance, and work your way through another example.  Or, if you want
to see if you can improve upon the First-Fit solution, you can switch into
Practice Mode via the "Mode" menu.  Switching into Practice Mode leaves all items
in bins as they are, but allows you to proceed to move things around.  Switching
into any other mode resets by removing all elements from bins.</p>

<h2><a name="ffd"></a>First-Fit Decreasing</h2>

Our next heuristic for Bin Packing is called First-Fit Decreasing.  It is similar to
First-Fit, but in First-Fit Decreasing, you always choose the largest remaining item.
Once the item is chosen, you place it in the first bin where it fits, just like with
First-Fit.  The rationale for choosing items in size order is that the larger items
will be the hardest to find good bins for placement, so start with those.

<p>In the Interactive Bin Packing Application, switch into First-Fit Decreasing Mode.
To make it easier to step through the First-Fit Decreasing heuristic, you might
consider using the sorting commands under the "Operations" menu.  If there are 2 or
more items tied as the largest, then it doesn't matter which item you pick.
Work your way through a full bin packing instance with the First-Fit Decreasing 
heuristic.</p>

<p>If you want more practice with First-Fit Decreasing, then use the "Problem" menu to generate 
a random instance, and work your way through another example.  Or, if you want
to see if you can improve upon the First-Fit Decreasing solution, you can switch into
Practice Mode via the "Mode" menu.</p>

<h2><a name="bf"></a>Best-Fit</h2>

The next Constructive Heuristic that we consider is called Best-Fit.  Just like First-Fit,
we simply iterate over the items in whatever arbitrary order they are given to us in.
So in the case of the Interactive Bin Packing Application, this order is alphabetical by item 
name.  But when faced with a choice of more than one bin where the item fits, the Best-Fit
heuristic chooses the bin that is closest to its capacity.

<p>Let's step through an example in the Interactive Bin Packing Application.  First,
if you changed to a random problem instance, switch back to the default instance for now
so that we can explain the difference in behavior compared to what we earlier saw with
First-Fit.  Then, make sure you choose the Best-Fit Mode via the "Mode" menu.
The first item that we will place is item A since we'll take the items in the arbitrary order
given, and we will place it in Bin 1. The application will actually allow you to place this
first item anywhere since all of the bins are the "best-fit" bin, but please choose Bin 1
to be consistent with the remainder of this explanation.  You will then also place item B
in Bin 1.  Since item C doesn't fit in Bin 1, you must start a new bin, placing it in Bin 2.
Likewise, item D will go in Bin 2.  So far, this is all identical to what the First-Fit heuristic
does for this problem instance.  But here is where we will see a difference.  The size
of the next item, E, is 7.  Bin 1 has 31 units of space remaining.  Bin 2 has 18 units of
space remaining.  Item E can fit in either bin.  Best-Fit chooses Bin 2 because it
is closer to capacity than Bin 1; whereas we previously saw that First-Fit chose Bin 1.
Continue to place the remaining items into bins using Best-Fit.</p>

<p>If you want more practice with Best-Fit, then use the "Problem" menu to generate 
a random instance, and work your way through another example.  Or, if you want
to see if you can improve upon the Best-Fit solution, you can switch into
Practice Mode via the "Mode" menu.</p>

<p>Return to <a href="#TOP">Top</a> or <a href="#ToC">Table of Contents</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="bfd"></a>Best-Fit Decreasing</h2>

Our final heuristic for Bin Packing is called Best-Fit Decreasing.  It is similar to
Best-Fit, but in Best-Fit Decreasing, you always choose the largest remaining item.
Once the item is chosen, you use the Best-Fit rule to pick the bin.  In particular,
of those bins where it will fit, you choose the bin closest to capacity.

<p>In the Interactive Bin Packing Application, switch into Best-Fit Decreasing Mode.
To make it easier to step through the Best-Fit Decreasing heuristic, you might
consider using the sorting commands under the "Operations" menu.  If there are 2 or
more items tied as the largest, then it doesn't matter which item you pick.
Work your way through a full bin packing instance with the Best-Fit Decreasing 
heuristic.</p>

<p>If you want more practice with Best-Fit Decreasing, then use the "Problem" menu to generate 
a random instance, and work your way through another example.  Or, if you want
to see if you can improve upon the Best-Fit Decreasing solution, you can switch into
Practice Mode via the "Mode" menu.</p>
