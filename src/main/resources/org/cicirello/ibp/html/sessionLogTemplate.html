The session log is organized as follows:
<ul>
<li><a href="#summary">Summary Statistics</a></li>
<li><a href="#alerts">Alerts</a></li>
<li><a href="#success">Heuristic Mode Successful Completions</a></li>
<li><a href="#logs">All Logged Actions</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="summary">Summary Statistics</h2>

<h2><a name="alerts">Alerts</h2>
This section is meant for instructors viewing session logs
submitted by students for assignments. Although we believe
that the amount of effort necessary to falsify a session
log is greater than the effort necessary to complete the
tutorial and any exercises assigned by the instructor,
the application performs some rudimentary analysis to detect
questionable records. This is where you will
find alerts for things that may imply suspicious activity,
such as inconsistent sequence of timestamps, problem instances
solved before they were started, entries claiming completion of
problem instances but with data for a different problem instance,
among others.
<p>Instructors should also inspect the summary statistics
section for time related issues. For example, at the present
time the application does not attempt to determine if the
total time in session is consistent with amount of activity
claimed by the session log.</p>
