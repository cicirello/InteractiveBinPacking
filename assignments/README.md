# Example Assignments

This directory contains example assignments that can be
used within the context of a course, or by individuals for
self-learning. 

Each example assignment is in its own subdirectory containing:
* A pdf file that is ready for distribution to students if you 
  don't have reason to modify the assignment. If you are a 
  self-learner and not part of a class, then the pdf files are 
  probably of interest to you.  
* LaTeX source files of the assignments, which make it easy 
  for other instructors to customize to their needs, and which 
  also makes it easy to provide comments intended only for 
  instructors. So if you are a course instructor, I recommend 
  reading the comments within the LaTeX files.

We recommend beginning with the assignment found in 
[assignments/1](1) or [assignments/2](2). These two assignments
are essentially the same, and includes working through the
entirety of the tutorial that is built into the application, as
well as completing a few follow-up exercises. If you are a self-directed
learner, go with [assignments/1](1). If you are a course instructor,
then [assignments/2](2) utilizes the Session Log feature to make
it easy for you to validate your students' work.  See the [full list
of available assignments](LIST_OF_ASSIGNMENTS.md) for more details

## License for Example Assignments

As noted in the README at the top level of the repository,
as well as in the Interactive Bin Packing application, its
source, files, etc, the Interactive Bin Packing application
itself is licensed under
the [GPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
However, the GPL license is designed for application to 
software, and as such doesn't lend itself well to licensing
documents such as the example homework assignments.

The example homework assignments contained in this directory
are licensed to you under 
the [CC BY-NC-SA (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). Why this license?
* It allows you to adapt the assignments to the needs of your 
  course. The example assignments would be rather useless otherwise,
  since what may work well for my course may work better for you if
  you change things here or there.
* It allows you to share. Example assignments would likewise be rather
  useless if you couldn't share them such as with your students.
* It requires attribution. As an academic, I feel that everything you use
  that was created by someone else should be properly attributed.
* NonCommercial: Well, this allows educators (or self-learning students)
  to use for educational purposes, but prevents resale as part of a 
  commercial product or other commercial use (e.g., prevents textbook
  publishers from including it as part of their books, etc).
* ShareAlike: If you change the assignments in some way and want to
  distribute your changed version, then you must use the same license.
  This keeps derivatives open.

## Note to Instructors

If you do create variations of the assignments that you think would
be useful to others, or if you create brand new assignments that utilize
the Interactive Bin Packing application in some way, then consider
contributing them directly to this project, by doing the following:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch.
3. Add the assignment files to the assignments directory.
4. Submit a pull request.
