# List of Available Example Assignments

If you have not already done so, begin by reading
the [README for the Assignments Directory](README.md).

The assignments currently available in the repository include:
* [assignments/1](1): The student works through the entire tutorial
  covering an introduction to combinatorial optimization, the bin
  packing problem, and constructive heuristics. After working their
  way through the tutorial, they then work through additional 
  exercises for each of the constructive heuristics for bin packing,
  and answer some follow-up questions related to the problem instances
  that they worked through.
* [assignments/2](2): This is essentially identical to assignments/1, but
  utilizes the Session Log feature of the Interactive Bin Packing application
  to make it easy for course instructors to validate student's work. One of
  the advantages for instructors of this variation of the assignment is that 
  each student uses a different problem instance, significantly reducing the
  chance that students will share work with each other. Despite each student
  using a different problem instance in this assignment, the Session Log feature
  has students save a Session Log that the instructor can then use to 
  verify that they have completed the required elements, including verifying
  that the student's work corresponds to correct application of the various
  constructive heuristics for that student's designated problem instance.
