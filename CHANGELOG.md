## [3.1.0] - 2021-06-24

### Added
* A directory of example homework assignments that can be used or adapted by
  course instructors using the application in a class. The example assignments
  can also be used by self-directed learners.
* Session Logs
  * Feature that logs most user interaction with the application, and
    generates an in-application view of the session log. 
  * The session log summarizes total time in the application, instances 
    solved by the user correctly using their chosen heuristic, number of 
    successful and unsuccessful solving actions taken in each of the 
    application modes, as well as additional information that may be useful 
    to instructors using the application within a course context.
  * In addition to viewing the current session log, session logs can be
    saved to a file. The motivation is to ease instructor grading of 
    assignments that use the application. For example, instructors can
    assign each student a different problem instance and have students save
    and submit the session log, which the instructor can then use for 
    validation.
  * The load session log feature loads a session log, validates it, and displays
    a human readable summary. The validation verifies that instances that are
    claimed solved using a particular heuristic were actually solved using that
    heuristic. That is, the session log doesn't include the solution, but rather
    it includes the actions taken to reach the solution, the problem instance
    number, and the chosen heuristic, and the application validates that the actions
    taken are those that the heuristic would have chosen. The validation also
    validates timestamp sequences, etc.
  * Note to instructors: We don't guarantee that the session logs cannot be
    faked. However, the effort required to fake a session log that will fool the
    validation is significantly more than the effort needed to work through the
    exercises. Additionally, to successfully fake a session log, the student would
    still need the correct sequence of actions to solve the specified instance
    using the specified heuristic. Simply assign each student a different
    problem instance number (it is a value of type long), perhaps based on their 
    student id number.

### Fixed
* Reorganized resources files (html content of dialogs, and images)
  to use a namespace (i.e., within a directory hierarchy based on package name).
  

## [3.0.1] - 2021-05-26

### Changed
* Updates to documentation.

### Fixed
* Code improvements to eliminate potentially errorprone 
  code as identified in MuseDev's static analysis reports.


## [3.0.0] - 2021-05-14

### Added
* Adopted SemVer versioning.
* First release to Maven Central Repository and to the GitHub Package Registry.

### Fixed
* Minor resource leak in unclosed Scanner.


## [3.0] - 2020-07-09

First public release.

### Added
* Automated tutorial features.
* Self-guided tutorial on combinatorial optimization, the bin 
  packing problem, and constructive heuristics for bin packing.
* Checks user's progress and provides feedback enabling user to test 
  their knowledge of the various constructive heuristics covered by 
  the tutorial.
* Help dialog box.
* Tutorial dialog box.
* Computation of lower bounds.
* Several heuristic modes that monitor user's interaction with
  bin packing instance and provides feedback on correctness of their
  usage of different constructive heuristics: first-fit, first-fit decreasing,
  best-fit, and best-fit decreasing.
  
### Changed
* Significant refactoring of existing code.


## [2.0] - 2010

* About dialog box.

### Changed
* Improvements to interface.


## [1.0] - 2008

### Added
* Interactively manipulate random instances of bin packing.
* Visualize random instances of bin packing.
